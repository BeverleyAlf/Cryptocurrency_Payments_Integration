   ```bash
   cryptocurrency_payment_gateway_integration.py
   ``` 

__Step 3:__ Handle Payment Callbacks

 - Cryptocurrency payment gateways typically send payment callbacks to notify your platform about transaction updates.
 - Create a URL endpoint to receive and process these payment callbacks from the payment gateway.

```payment_callback_handling.py```

__Step 4:__ Handle Payment Callbacks

Cryptocurrency payment gateways typically send payment callbacks to notify your platform about transaction updates.
Create a URL endpoint to receive and process these payment callbacks from the payment gateway.
